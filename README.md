This is my first ever project, a simple Inline 3 engine. It is a Big Bang configuration, which means the engine will fire the two back end cylinders at the same time.
This is an uncommon firing order, however it draws tons of power out of the engine if done right.
Feel free to modify my script. If possible, please credit me where due.


SPECS:
Top Speed - 149mph
Horsepower Estimate - 200HP
Cylinder Number - 3, firing in 1,2+3

The goal of this engine was to make an engine that would be as efficient as possible, while retaining the properties of an inline 3. 
I had lots of fun developing this engine, and I hope you all do too.
